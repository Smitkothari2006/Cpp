/* ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement:
Create a base class `Animal` with a method `sound()`.
Derive classes `Dog` and `Cat` from `Animal`, overriding the `sound()` method.
Use a pointer of type `Animal*` to refer to objects of derived classes.
Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the `sound()` method through the base class pointer.
